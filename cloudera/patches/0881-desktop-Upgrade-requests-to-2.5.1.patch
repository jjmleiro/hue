-Release History
----------------
-
-2.0.0 (2013-09-24)
-++++++++++++++++++
-
-**API Changes:**
-
-- Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python versions,
-  i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.
-- Proxy URLs now *must* have an explicit scheme. A ``MissingSchema`` exception
-  will be raised if they don't.
-- Timeouts now apply to read time if ``Stream=False``.
-- ``RequestException`` is now a subclass of ``IOError``, not ``RuntimeError``.
-- Added new method to ``PreparedRequest`` objects: ``PreparedRequest.copy()``.
-- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.update_request()``. This
-  method updates a ``Request`` object with the data (e.g. cookies) stored on
-  the ``Session``.
-- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.prepare_request()``. This
-  method updates and prepares a ``Request`` object, and returns the
-  corresponding ``PreparedRequest`` object.
-- Added new method to ``HTTPAdapter`` objects: ``HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()``.
-  This should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.
-- ``httplib.IncompleteRead`` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding
-  will now raise a Requests ``ChunkedEncodingError`` instead.
-- Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ``InvalidURL``
-  exception to be raised.
-- HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase ``"im_used"``. Correctly uses
-  ``"already_reported"``.
-- HTTP 226 reason added (``"im_used"``).
-
-**Bugfixes:**
-
-- Vastly improved proxy support, including the CONNECT verb. Special thanks to
-  the many contributors who worked towards this improvement.
-- Cookies are now properly managed when 401 authentication responses are
-  received.
-- Chunked encoding fixes.
-- Support for mixed case schemes.
-- Better handling of streaming downloads.
-- Retrieve environment proxies from more locations.
-- Minor cookies fixes.
-- Imroved redirect behaviour.
-- Improved streaming behaviour, particularly for compressed data.
-- Miscellaneous small Python 3 text encoding bugs.
-- ``.netrc`` no longer overrides explicit auth.
-- Cookies set by hooks are now correctly persisted on Sessions.
-- Fix problem with cookies that specify port numbers in their host field.
-- ``BytesIO`` can be used to perform streaming uploads.
-- More generous parsing of the ``no_proxy`` environment variable.
-- Non-string objects can be passed in data values alongside files.
-
-1.2.3 (2013-05-25)
-++++++++++++++++++
-
-- Simple packaging fix
-
-
-1.2.2 (2013-05-23)
-++++++++++++++++++
-
-- Simple packaging fix
-
-
-1.2.1 (2013-05-20)
-++++++++++++++++++
-
-- Python 3.3.2 compatibility
-- Always percent-encode location headers
-- Fix connection adapter matching to be most-specific first
-- new argument to the default connection adapter for passing a block argument
-- prevent a KeyError when there's no link headers
-
-1.2.0 (2013-03-31)
-++++++++++++++++++
-
-- Fixed cookies on sessions and on requests
-- Significantly change how hooks are dispatched - hooks now receive all the
-  arguments specified by the user when making a request so hooks can make a
-  secondary request with the same parameters. This is especially necessary for
-  authentication handler authors
-- certifi support was removed
-- Fixed bug where using OAuth 1 with body ``signature_type`` sent no data
-- Major proxy work thanks to @Lukasa including parsing of proxy authentication
-  from the proxy url
-- Fix DigestAuth handling too many 401s
-- Update vendored urllib3 to include SSL bug fixes
-- Allow keyword arguments to be passed to ``json.loads()`` via the
-  ``Response.json()`` method
-- Don't send ``Content-Length`` header by default on ``GET`` or ``HEAD``
-  requests
-- Add ``elapsed`` attribute to ``Response`` objects to time how long a request
-  took.
-- Fix ``RequestsCookieJar``
-- Sessions and Adapters are now picklable, i.e., can be used with the
-  multiprocessing library
-- Update charade to version 1.0.3
-
-The change in how hooks are dispatched will likely cause a great deal of
-issues.
-
-1.1.0 (2013-01-10)
-++++++++++++++++++
-
-- CHUNKED REQUESTS
-- Support for iterable response bodies
-- Assume servers persist redirect params
-- Allow explicit content types to be specified for file data
-- Make merge_kwargs case-insensitive when looking up keys
-

-Requests: HTTP for Humans
-=========================
-
-.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/requests.png
-    :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/requests
-
-.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/kennethreitz/requests.png?branch=master
-        :target: https://travis-ci.org/kennethreitz/requests
-
-.. image:: https://pypip.in/d/requests/badge.png
-        :target: https://crate.io/packages/requests/
-
-Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human
-beings.
-
-Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely
-verbose and cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most of
-the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly broken.
-It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to
-perform the simplest of tasks.
-
-Things shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.
-
-.. code-block:: pycon
-
-    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))
-    >>> r.status_code
-    204
-    >>> r.headers['content-type']
-    'application/json'
-    >>> r.text
-    ...
-
-See `the same code, without Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.
-
-Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data,
-multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the
-response data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and `urllib3
-<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_, but it does all the hard work and crazy
-hacks for you.
-
-

-
-.. code-block:: bash
-
-    $ easy_install requests

-krTheme Sphinx Style
-====================
-
-This repository contains sphinx styles Kenneth Reitz uses in most of
-his projects. It is a derivative of Mitsuhiko's themes for Flask and Flask related
-projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
-this guide:
-
-1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
-   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.
-
-2. add this to your conf.py: ::
-
-    sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
-    html_theme_path = ['_themes']
-    html_theme = 'flask'
-
-The following themes exist:
-
-**kr**
-    the standard flask documentation theme for large projects
-
-**kr_small**
-    small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by very small addon libraries.
-

-Developer Interface
-===================
-
-.. module:: requests
-
-This part of the documentation covers all the interfaces of Requests.  For
-parts where Requests depends on external libraries, we document the most
-important right here and provide links to the canonical documentation.
-
-
-Main Interface
---------------
-
-All of Requests' functionality can be accessed by these 7 methods.
-They all return an instance of the :class:`Response <Response>` object.
-
-.. autofunction:: request
-
-.. autofunction:: head
-.. autofunction:: get
-.. autofunction:: post
-.. autofunction:: put
-.. autofunction:: patch
-.. autofunction:: delete
-
-
-Lower-Level Classes

-Migrating to 1.x
-----------------
-
-This section details the main differences between 0.x and 1.x and is meant
-to ease the pain of upgrading.
-
-
-API Changes
-~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-* ``Response.json`` is now a callable and not a property of a response.
-
-  ::
-
-      import requests
-      r = requests.get('https://github.com/timeline.json')
-      r.json()   # This *call* raises an exception if JSON decoding fails
-
-* The ``Session`` API has changed. Sessions objects no longer take parameters.
-  ``Session`` is also now capitalized, but it can still be
-  instantiated with a lowercase ``session`` for backwards compatibility.
-
-  ::
-
-      s = requests.Session()    # formerly, session took parameters
-      s.auth = auth
-      s.headers.update(headers)
-      r = s.get('http://httpbin.org/headers')
-
-* All request hooks have been removed except 'response'.
-
-* Authentication helpers have been broken out into separate modules. See
-  requests-oauthlib_ and requests-kerberos_.
-
-.. _requests-oauthlib: https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib
-.. _requests-kerberos: https://github.com/requests/requests-kerberos
-
-* The parameter for streaming requests was changed from ``prefetch`` to
-  ``stream`` and the logic was inverted. In addition, ``stream`` is now
-  required for raw response reading.
-
-  ::
-
-      # in 0.x, passing prefetch=False would accomplish the same thing
-      r = requests.get('https://github.com/timeline.json', stream=True)
-      for chunk in r.iter_content(8192):
-          ...
-
-* The ``config`` parameter to the requests method has been removed. Some of
-  these options are now configured on a ``Session`` such as keep-alive and
-  maximum number of redirects. The verbosity option should be handled by
-  configuring logging.
-
-  ::
-
-      import requests
-      import logging
-
-      # these two lines enable debugging at httplib level (requests->urllib3->httplib)
-      # you will see the REQUEST, including HEADERS and DATA, and RESPONSE with HEADERS but without DATA.
-      # the only thing missing will be the response.body which is not logged.
-      import httplib
-      httplib.HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1
-

-Licensing
-~~~~~~~~~
-
-One key difference that has nothing to do with the API is a change in the
-license from the ISC_ license to the `Apache 2.0`_ license. The Apache 2.0
-license ensures that contributions to Requests are also covered by the Apache
-2.0 license.

-
-Frequently Asked Questions
-==========================
-
-This part of the documentation answers common questions about Requests.
-
-Encoded Data?
--------------
-
-Requests automatically decompresses gzip-encoded responses, and does
-its best to decode response content to unicode when possible.
-
-You can get direct access to the raw response (and even the socket),
-if needed as well.
-
-
-Custom User-Agents?
--------------------
-
-Requests allows you to easily override User-Agent strings, along with
-any other HTTP Header.
-
-
-Why not Httplib2?
------------------
-
-Chris Adams gave an excellent summary on
-`Hacker News <http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2884406>`_:
-
-    httplib2 is part of why you should use requests: it's far more respectable
-    as a client but not as well documented and it still takes way too much code
-    for basic operations. I appreciate what httplib2 is trying to do, that
-    there's a ton of hard low-level annoyances in building a modern HTTP
-    client, but really, just use requests instead. Kenneth Reitz is very
-    motivated and he gets the degree to which simple things should be simple
-    whereas httplib2 feels more like an academic exercise than something
-    people should use to build production systems[1].
-
-    Disclosure: I'm listed in the requests AUTHORS file but can claim credit
-    for, oh, about 0.0001% of the awesomeness.
-
-    1. http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/issues/detail?id=96 is a good example:
-    an annoying bug which affect many people, there was a fix available for
-    months, which worked great when I applied it in a fork and pounded a couple
-    TB of data through it, but it took over a year to make it into trunk and
-    even longer to make it onto PyPI where any other project which required "
-    httplib2" would get the working version.
-
-
-Python 3 Support?
------------------
-
-Yes! Here's a list of Python platforms that are officially
-supported:
-
-* Python 2.6
-* Python 2.7
-* Python 3.1
-* Python 3.2
-* Python 3.3
-* PyPy 1.9

-Development Philosophy
-======================
-
-Requests is an open but opinionated library, created by an open but opinionated developer.
-
-
-Benevolent Dictator
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-`Kenneth Reitz <http://kennethreitz.org>`_ is the BDFL. He has final say in any decision related to Requests.
-
-Values
-~~~~~~
-
-- Simplicity is always better than functionality.
-- Listen to everyone, then disregard it.
-- The API is all that matters. Everything else is secondary.
-- Fit the 90% use-case. Ignore the nay-sayers.
-
-Semantic Versioning
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-For many years, the open source community has been plagued with version number dystonia. Numbers vary so greatly from project to project, they are practically meaningless.
-
-Requests uses `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_. This specification seeks to put an end to this madness with a small set of practical guidelines for you and your colleagues to use in your next project.
-
-Standard Library?
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Requests has no *active* plans to be included in the standard library. This decision has been discussed at length with Guido as well as numerous core developers.
-
-Essentially, the standard library is where a library goes to die. It is appropriate for a module to be included when active development is no longer necessary.
-
-Requests just reached v1.0.0. This huge milestone marks a major step in the right direction.
-
-Linux Distro Packages
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Distributions have been made for many Linux repositories, including: Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, and Arch.
-
-These distributions are sometimes divergent forks, or are otherwise not kept up-to-date with the latest code and bugfixes. PyPI (and its mirrors) and GitHub are the official distribution sources; alternatives are not supported by the Requests project.

-How to Help
-===========
-
-Requests is under active development, and contributions are more than welcome!
-
-#. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a bug.
-   There is a Contributor Friendly tag for issues that should be ideal for people who are not very
-   familiar with the codebase yet.
-#. Fork `the repository <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_ on GitHub and start making your
-   changes to a new branch.
-#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed.
-#. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published. :)
-   Make sure to add yourself to `AUTHORS <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst>`_.
-
-Feature Freeze
---------------
-
-As of v1.0.0, Requests has now entered a feature freeze. Requests for new
-features and Pull Requests implementing those features will not be accepted.
-
-Development Dependencies
-------------------------
-
-You'll need to install py.test in order to run the Requests' test suite::
-
-    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
-    $ invoke test
-    py.test
-    platform darwin -- Python 2.7.3 -- pytest-2.3.4
-    collected 25 items
-
-    test_requests.py .........................
-    25 passed in 3.50 seconds
-
-Runtime Environments
---------------------
-
-Requests currently supports the following versions of Python:
-
-- Python 2.6
-- Python 2.7
-- Python 3.1
-- Python 3.2
-- Python 3.3
-- PyPy 1.9
-
-Support for Python 3.1 and 3.2 may be dropped at any time.
-
-Google App Engine will never be officially supported. Pull Requests for compatibility will be accepted, as long as they don't complicate the codebase.
-
-
-Are you crazy?
---------------
-
-- SPDY support would be awesome. No C extensions.
-
-Downstream Repackaging
-----------------------
-
-If you are repackaging Requests, please note that you must also redistribute the ``cacerts.pem`` file in order to get correct SSL functionality.

-Requests: HTTP for Humans
-=========================
-
-Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>`)
-
-Requests is an :ref:`Apache2 Licensed <apache2>` HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings.
-
-Python's standard **urllib2** module provides most of
-the HTTP capabilities you need, but the API is thoroughly **broken**.
-It was built for a different time — and a different web. It requires an *enormous* amount of work (even method overrides) to perform the simplest of tasks.
-
-Things shouldn’t be this way. Not in Python.
-
-::
-
-    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
-    >>> r.status_code
-    200
-    >>> r.headers['content-type']
-    'application/json; charset=utf8'
-    >>> r.encoding
-    'utf-8'
-    >>> r.text
-    u'{"type":"User"...'
-    >>> r.json()
-    {u'private_gists': 419, u'total_private_repos': 77, ...}
-
-See `similar code, without Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.
-
-Requests takes all of the work out of Python HTTP/1.1 — making your integration with web services seamless. There's no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100%  automatic, powered by `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_, which is embedded within Requests.
-
-
-Testimonials
-------------
-
-Her Majesty's Government, Amazon, Google, Twilio, Runscope, Mozilla, Heroku, PayPal, NPR, Obama for America, Transifex, Native Instruments, The Washington Post, Twitter, SoundCloud, Kippt, Readability, and Federal US Institutions use Requests internally. It has been downloaded over 5,000,000 times from PyPI.
-
-**Armin Ronacher**
-    Requests is the perfect example how beautiful an API can be with the
-    right level of abstraction.
-
-**Matt DeBoard**
-    I'm going to get @kennethreitz's Python requests module tattooed
-    on my body, somehow. The whole thing.
-
-**Daniel Greenfeld**
-    Nuked a 1200 LOC spaghetti code library with 10 lines of code thanks to
-    @kennethreitz's request library. Today has been AWESOME.
-
-**Kenny Meyers**
-    Python HTTP: When in doubt, or when not in doubt, use Requests. Beautiful,
-    simple, Pythonic.
-
-
-Feature Support

-
-Advanced Usage
-==============
-
-This document covers some of Requests more advanced features.
-
-
-Session Objects
----------------
-
-The Session object allows you to persist certain parameters across
-requests. It also persists cookies across all requests made from the
-Session instance.
-
-A Session object has all the methods of the main Requests API.
-
-Let's persist some cookies across requests::
-
-    s = requests.Session()
-
-    s.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789')
-    r = s.get("http://httpbin.org/cookies")
-
-    print r.text
-    # '{"cookies": {"sessioncookie": "123456789"}}'
-
-
-Sessions can also be used to provide default data to the request methods. This
-is done by providing data to the properties on a Session object::
-
-    s = requests.Session()
-    s.auth = ('user', 'pass')
-    s.headers.update({'x-test': 'true'})
-
-    # both 'x-test' and 'x-test2' are sent
-    s.get('http://httpbin.org/headers', headers={'x-test2': 'true'})
-
-
-Any dictionaries that you pass to a request method will be merged with the session-level values that are set. The method-level parameters override session parameters.
-
-.. admonition:: Remove a Value From a Dict Parameter
-
-    Sometimes you'll want to omit session-level keys from a dict parameter. To do this, you simply set that key's value to ``None`` in the method-level parameter. It will automatically be omitted.
-
-All values that are contained within a session are directly available to you. See the :ref:`Session API Docs <sessionapi>` to learn more.
-
-Request and Response Objects
-----------------------------
-
-Whenever a call is made to requests.*() you are doing two major things. First,
-you are constructing a ``Request`` object which will be sent off to a server
-to request or query some resource. Second, a ``Response`` object is generated
-once ``requests`` gets a response back from the server. The Response object
-contains all of the information returned by the server and also contains the
-``Request`` object you created originally. Here is a simple request to get some
-very important information from Wikipedia's servers::
-
-    >>> r = requests.get('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python')
-
-If we want to access the headers the server sent back to us, we do this::
-
-    >>> r.headers
-    {'content-length': '56170', 'x-content-type-options': 'nosniff', 'x-cache':
-    'HIT from cp1006.eqiad.wmnet, MISS from cp1010.eqiad.wmnet', 'content-encoding':
-    'gzip', 'age': '3080', 'content-language': 'en', 'vary': 'Accept-Encoding,Cookie',
-    'server': 'Apache', 'last-modified': 'Wed, 13 Jun 2012 01:33:50 GMT',
-    'connection': 'close', 'cache-control': 'private, s-maxage=0, max-age=0,
-    must-revalidate', 'date': 'Thu, 14 Jun 2012 12:59:39 GMT', 'content-type':
-    'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'x-cache-lookup': 'HIT from cp1006.eqiad.wmnet:3128,
-    MISS from cp1010.eqiad.wmnet:80'}
-
-However, if we want to get the headers we sent the server, we simply access the
-request, and then the request's headers::
-
-    >>> r.request.headers
-    {'Accept-Encoding': 'identity, deflate, compress, gzip',
-    'Accept': '*/*', 'User-Agent': 'python-requests/1.2.0'}
-
-Prepared Requests
------------------
-
-Whenever you receive a :class:`Response <requests.models.Response>` object
-from an API call or a Session call, the ``request`` attribute is actually the
-``PreparedRequest`` that was used. In some cases you may wish to do some extra
-work to the body or headers (or anything else really) before sending a
-request. The simple recipe for this is the following::
-
-    from requests import Request, Session
-
-    s = Session()
-    prepped = Request('GET',  # or any other method, 'POST', 'PUT', etc.
-                      url,
-                      data=data
-                      headers=headers
-                      # ...
-                      ).prepare()
-    # do something with prepped.body
-    # do something with prepped.headers
-    resp = s.send(prepped,
-                  stream=stream,
-                  verify=verify,
-                  proxies=proxies,
-                  cert=cert,
-                  timeout=timeout,
-                  # etc.
-                  )
-    print(resp.status_code)
-
-Since you are not doing anything special with the ``Request`` object, you
-prepare it immediately and modified the ``PreparedRequest`` object. You then
-send that with the other parameters you would have sent to ``requests.*`` or
-``Sesssion.*``.
-
-SSL Cert Verification
----------------------
-
-Requests can verify SSL certificates for HTTPS requests, just like a web browser. To check a host's SSL certificate, you can use the ``verify`` argument::
-
-    >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.com', verify=True)
-    requests.exceptions.SSLError: hostname 'kennethreitz.com' doesn't match either of '*.herokuapp.com', 'herokuapp.com'
-
-I don't have SSL setup on this domain, so it fails. Excellent. GitHub does though::
-
-    >>> requests.get('https://github.com', verify=True)
-    <Response [200]>
-
-You can also pass ``verify`` the path to a CA_BUNDLE file for private certs. You can also set the ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`` environment variable.
-
-Requests can also ignore verifying the SSL certificate if you set ``verify`` to False.
-
-::
-
-    >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.com', verify=False)
-    <Response [200]>
-
-By default, ``verify`` is set to True. Option ``verify`` only applies to host certs.
-
-You can also specify a local cert to use as client side certificate, as a single file (containing the private key and the certificate) or as a tuple of both file's path::
-
-    >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.com', cert=('/path/server.crt', '/path/key'))
-    <Response [200]>
-
-If you specify a wrong path or an invalid cert::
-
-    >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.com', cert='/wrong_path/server.pem')
-    SSLError: [Errno 336265225] _ssl.c:347: error:140B0009:SSL routines:SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file:PEM lib
-
-
-Body Content Workflow
----------------------
-
-By default, when you make a request, the body of the response is downloaded immediately. You can override this behavior and defer downloading the response body until you access the :class:`Response.content` attribute with the ``stream`` parameter::
-
-    tarball_url = 'https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/tarball/master'
-    r = requests.get(tarball_url, stream=True)
-
-At this point only the response headers have been downloaded and the connection remains open, hence allowing us to make content retrieval conditional::
-
-    if int(r.headers['content-length']) < TOO_LONG:
-      content = r.content
-      ...
-
-You can further control the workflow by use of the :class:`Response.iter_content` and :class:`Response.iter_lines` methods. Alternatively, you can read the undecoded body from the underlying urllib3 :class:`urllib3.HTTPResponse` at :class:`Response.raw`.
-
-
-Keep-Alive
-----------
-
-Excellent news — thanks to urllib3, keep-alive is 100% automatic within a session! Any requests that you make within a session will automatically reuse the appropriate connection!
-
-Note that connections are only released back to the pool for reuse once all body data has been read; be sure to either set ``stream`` to ``False`` or read the ``content`` property of the ``Response`` object.
-
-
-Streaming Uploads
------------------
-
-Requests supports streaming uploads, which allow you to send large streams or files without reading them into memory. To stream and upload, simply provide a file-like object for your body::
-
-    with open('massive-body') as f:
-        requests.post('http://some.url/streamed', data=f)
-
-
-Chunk-Encoded Requests
-----------------------
-
-Requests also supports Chunked transfer encoding for outgoing and incoming requests. To send a chunk-encoded request, simply provide a generator (or any iterator without a length) for your body::
-
-
-    def gen():
-        yield 'hi'
-        yield 'there'
-
-    requests.post('http://some.url/chunked', data=gen())
-
-
-Event Hooks
------------
-
-Requests has a hook system that you can use to manipulate portions of
-the request process, or signal event handling.
-
-Available hooks:
-
-``response``:
-    The response generated from a Request.
-
-
-You can assign a hook function on a per-request basis by passing a
-``{hook_name: callback_function}`` dictionary to the ``hooks`` request
-parameter::
-
-    hooks=dict(response=print_url)
-
-That ``callback_function`` will receive a chunk of data as its first
-argument.
-
-::
-
-    def print_url(r, *args, **kwargs):
-        print(r.url)
-
-If an error occurs while executing your callback, a warning is given.
-
-If the callback function returns a value, it is assumed that it is to
-replace the data that was passed in. If the function doesn't return
-anything, nothing else is effected.
-
-Let's print some request method arguments at runtime::
-
-    >>> requests.get('http://httpbin.org', hooks=dict(response=print_url))
-    http://httpbin.org
-    <Response [200]>
-
-
-Custom Authentication
----------------------
-
-Requests allows you to use specify your own authentication mechanism.
-
-Any callable which is passed as the ``auth`` argument to a request method will
-have the opportunity to modify the request before it is dispatched.
-
-Authentication implementations are subclasses of ``requests.auth.AuthBase``,
-and are easy to define. Requests provides two common authentication scheme
-implementations in ``requests.auth``: ``HTTPBasicAuth`` and ``HTTPDigestAuth``.
-
-Let's pretend that we have a web service that will only respond if the
-``X-Pizza`` header is set to a password value. Unlikely, but just go with it.
-
-::
-
-    from requests.auth import AuthBase
-
-    class PizzaAuth(AuthBase):
-        """Attaches HTTP Pizza Authentication to the given Request object."""
-        def __init__(self, username):
-            # setup any auth-related data here
-            self.username = username
-
-        def __call__(self, r):
-            # modify and return the request
-            r.headers['X-Pizza'] = self.username
-            return r
-
-Then, we can make a request using our Pizza Auth::
-
-    >>> requests.get('http://pizzabin.org/admin', auth=PizzaAuth('kenneth'))
-    <Response [200]>
-
-.. _streaming-requests
-
-Streaming Requests
-------------------
-
-With ``requests.Response.iter_lines()`` you can easily iterate over streaming
-APIs such as the `Twitter Streaming API <https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api>`_.
-
-To use the Twitter Streaming API to track the keyword "requests"::
-
-    import json
-    import requests
-
-    r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/stream/20', stream=True)
-
-    for line in r.iter_lines():
-
-        # filter out keep-alive new lines
-        if line:
-            print json.loads(line)
-
-
-Proxies
--------
-
-If you need to use a proxy, you can configure individual requests with the
-``proxies`` argument to any request method::
-
-    import requests
-
-    proxies = {
-      "http": "http://10.10.1.10:3128",
-      "https": "http://10.10.1.10:1080",
-    }
-
-    requests.get("http://example.org", proxies=proxies)
-
-You can also configure proxies by environment variables ``HTTP_PROXY`` and ``HTTPS_PROXY``.
-
-::
-
-    $ export HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:3128"
-    $ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:1080"
-    $ python
-    >>> import requests
-    >>> requests.get("http://example.org")
-
-To use HTTP Basic Auth with your proxy, use the `http://user:password@host/` syntax::
-
-    proxies = {
-        "http": "http://user:pass@10.10.1.10:3128/",
-    }
-
-Compliance
-----------
-
-Requests is intended to be compliant with all relevant specifications and
-RFCs where that compliance will not cause difficulties for users. This
-attention to the specification can lead to some behaviour that may seem
-unusual to those not familiar with the relevant specification.
-
-Encodings
-^^^^^^^^^
-
-When you receive a response, Requests makes a guess at the encoding to use for
-decoding the response when you call the ``Response.text`` method. Requests
-will first check for an encoding in the HTTP header, and if none is present,
-will use `charade <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/charade>`_ to attempt to guess
-the encoding.
-
-The only time Requests will not do this is if no explicit charset is present
-in the HTTP headers **and** the ``Content-Type`` header contains ``text``. In
-this situation,
-`RFC 2616 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.7.1>`_
-specifies that the default charset must be ``ISO-8859-1``. Requests follows
-the specification in this case. If you require a different encoding, you can
-manually set the ``Response.encoding`` property, or use the raw
-``Response.content``.
-
-HTTP Verbs
-----------
-
-Requests provides access to almost the full range of HTTP verbs: GET, OPTIONS,
-HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. The following provides detailed examples of
-using these various verbs in Requests, using the GitHub API.
-
-We will begin with the verb most commonly used: GET. HTTP GET is an idempotent
-method that returns a resource from a given URL. As a result, it is the verb
-you ought to use when attempting to retrieve data from a web location. An
-example usage would be attempting to get information about a specific commit
-from GitHub. Suppose we wanted commit ``a050faf`` on Requests. We would get it
-like so::
-
-    >>> import requests
-    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/kennethreitz/requests/git/commits/a050faf084662f3a352dd1a941f2c7c9f886d4ad')
-
-We should confirm that GitHub responded correctly. If it has, we want to work
-out what type of content it is. Do this like so::
-
-    >>> if (r.status_code == requests.codes.ok):
-    ...     print r.headers['content-type']
-    ...
-    application/json; charset=utf-8
-
-So, GitHub returns JSON. That's great, we can use the ``r.json`` method to
-parse it into Python objects.
-
-::
-
-    >>> commit_data = r.json()
-    >>> print commit_data.keys()
-    [u'committer', u'author', u'url', u'tree', u'sha', u'parents', u'message']

-
-So far, so simple. Well, let's investigate the GitHub API a little bit. Now,
-we could look at the documentation, but we might have a little more fun if we
-use Requests instead. We can take advantage of the Requests OPTIONS verb to
-see what kinds of HTTP methods are supported on the url we just used.
-
-::
-
-    >>> verbs = requests.options(r.url)
-    >>> verbs.status_code
-    500
-
-Uh, what? That's unhelpful! Turns out GitHub, like many API providers, don't
-actually implement the OPTIONS method. This is an annoying oversight, but it's
-OK, we can just use the boring documentation. If GitHub had correctly
-implemented OPTIONS, however, they should return the allowed methods in the
-headers, e.g.
-
-::
-
-    >>> verbs = requests.options('http://a-good-website.com/api/cats')
-    >>> print verbs.headers['allow']
-    GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS
-
-Turning to the documentation, we see that the only other method allowed for
-commits is POST, which creates a new commit. As we're using the Requests repo,
-we should probably avoid making ham-handed POSTS to it. Instead, let's play
-with the Issues feature of GitHub.
-
-This documentation was added in response to Issue #482. Given that this issue
-already exists, we will use it as an example. Let's start by getting it.
-
-::
-
-    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/kennethreitz/requests/issues/482')
-    >>> r.status_code
-    200
-    >>> issue = json.loads(r.text)
-    >>> print issue[u'title']
-    Feature any http verb in docs
-    >>> print issue[u'comments']
-    3
-
-Cool, we have three comments. Let's take a look at the last of them.
-
-::
-
-    >>> r = requests.get(r.url + u'/comments')
-    >>> r.status_code
-    200
-    >>> comments = r.json()
-    >>> print comments[0].keys()
-    [u'body', u'url', u'created_at', u'updated_at', u'user', u'id']
-    >>> print comments[2][u'body']
-    Probably in the "advanced" section
-
-Well, that seems like a silly place. Let's post a comment telling the poster
-that he's silly. Who is the poster, anyway?
-
-::
-
-    >>> print comments[2][u'user'][u'login']
-    kennethreitz
-
-OK, so let's tell this Kenneth guy that we think this example should go in the
-quickstart guide instead. According to the GitHub API doc, the way to do this
-is to POST to the thread. Let's do it.
-
-::
-
-    >>> body = json.dumps({u"body": u"Sounds great! I'll get right on it!"})
-    >>> url = u"https://api.github.com/repos/kennethreitz/requests/issues/482/comments"
-    >>> r = requests.post(url=url, data=body)
-    >>> r.status_code
-    404
-
-Huh, that's weird. We probably need to authenticate. That'll be a pain, right?
-Wrong. Requests makes it easy to use many forms of authentication, including
-the very common Basic Auth.
-
-::
-
-    >>> from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
-    >>> auth = HTTPBasicAuth('fake@example.com', 'not_a_real_password')
-    >>> r = requests.post(url=url, data=body, auth=auth)
-    >>> r.status_code
-    201
-    >>> content = r.json()
-    >>> print content[u'body']
-    Sounds great! I'll get right on it.
-
-Brilliant. Oh, wait, no! I meant to add that it would take me a while, because
-I had to go feed my cat. If only I could edit this comment! Happily, GitHub
-allows us to use another HTTP verb, PATCH, to edit this comment. Let's do
-that.
-
-::
-
-    >>> print content[u"id"]
-    5804413
-    >>> body = json.dumps({u"body": u"Sounds great! I'll get right on it once I feed my cat."})
-    >>> url = u"https://api.github.com/repos/kennethreitz/requests/issues/comments/5804413"
-    >>> r = requests.patch(url=url, data=body, auth=auth)
-    >>> r.status_code
-    200
-
-Excellent. Now, just to torture this Kenneth guy, I've decided to let him
-sweat and not tell him that I'm working on this. That means I want to delete
-this comment. GitHub lets us delete comments using the incredibly aptly named
-DELETE method. Let's get rid of it.
-
-::
-
-    >>> r = requests.delete(url=url, auth=auth)
-    >>> r.status_code
-    204
-    >>> r.headers['status']
-    '204 No Content'
-
-Excellent. All gone. The last thing I want to know is how much of my ratelimit
-I've used. Let's find out. GitHub sends that information in the headers, so
-rather than download the whole page I'll send a HEAD request to get the
-headers.
-
-::
-
-    >>> r = requests.head(url=url, auth=auth)
-    >>> print r.headers
-    ...
-    'x-ratelimit-remaining': '4995'
-    'x-ratelimit-limit': '5000'
-    ...
-
-Excellent. Time to write a Python program that abuses the GitHub API in all
-kinds of exciting ways, 4995 more times.
-
-Link Headers
-------------
-
-Many HTTP APIs feature Link headers. They make APIs more self describing and discoverable.
-
-GitHub uses these for `pagination <http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination>`_ in their API, for example::
-
-    >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=1&per_page=10'
-    >>> r = requests.head(url=url)
-    >>> r.headers['link']
-    '<https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=2&per_page=10>; rel="next", <https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=6&per_page=10>; rel="last"'
-
-Requests will automatically parse these link headers and make them easily consumable::
-
-    >>> r.links["next"]
-    {'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=2&per_page=10', 'rel': 'next'}
-
-    >>> r.links["last"]
-    {'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=7&per_page=10', 'rel': 'last'}
-
-Transport Adapters
-------------------
-
-As of v1.0.0, Requests has moved to a modular internal design. Part of the
-reason this was done was to implement Transport Adapters, originally
-`described here`_. Transport Adapters provide a mechanism to define interaction
-methods for an HTTP service. In particular, they allow you to apply per-service
-configuration.
-
-Requests ships with a single Transport Adapter, the
-:class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`. This adapter provides the
-default Requests interaction with HTTP and HTTPS using the powerful `urllib3`_
-library. Whenever a Requests :class:`Session <Session>` is initialized, one of
-these is attached to the :class:`Session <Session>` object for HTTP, and one
-for HTTPS.
-
-Requests enables users to create and use their own Transport Adapters that
-provide specific functionality. Once created, a Transport Adapter can be
-mounted to a Session object, along with an indication of which web services
-it should apply to.
-
-::
-
-    >>> s = requests.Session()
-    >>> s.mount('http://www.github.com', MyAdapter())
-
-The mount call registers a specific instance of a Transport Adapter to a
-prefix. Once mounted, any HTTP request made using that session whose URL starts
-with the given prefix will use the given Transport Adapter.
-
-Implementing a Transport Adapter is beyond the scope of this documentation, but
-a good start would be to subclass the ``requests.adapters.BaseAdapter`` class.
-
-.. _`described here`: http://kennethreitz.org/exposures/the-future-of-python-http
-.. _`urllib3`: https://github.com/shazow/urllib3
-
-Blocking Or Non-Blocking?
--------------------------
-
-With the default Transport Adapter in place, Requests does not provide any kind
-of non-blocking IO. The ``Response.content`` property will block until the
-entire response has been downloaded. If you require more granularity, the
-streaming features of the library (see :ref:`streaming-requests`) allow you to
-retrieve smaller quantities of the response at a time. However, these calls
-will still block.
-
-If you are concerned about the use of blocking IO, there are lots of projects
-out there that combine Requests with one of Python's asynchronicity frameworks.
-Two excellent examples are `grequests`_ and `requests-futures`_.

-
-Authentication
-==============
-
-This document discusses using various kinds of authentication with Requests.
-
-Many web services require authentication, and there are many different types.
-Below, we outline various forms of authentication available in Requests, from
-the simple to the complex.
-
-
-Basic Authentication
---------------------
-
-Many web services that require authentication accept HTTP Basic Auth. This is
-the simplest kind, and Requests supports it straight out of the box.
-
-Making requests with HTTP Basic Auth is very simple::
-
-    >>> from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
-    >>> requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=HTTPBasicAuth('user', 'pass'))
-    <Response [200]>
-
-In fact, HTTP Basic Auth is so common that Requests provides a handy shorthand
-for using it::
-
-    >>> requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
-    <Response [200]>
-
-Providing the credentials in a tuple like this is exactly the same as the
-``HTTPBasicAuth`` example above.
-
-
-netrc Authentication
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-If no authentication method is given with the ``auth`` argument, Requests will
-attempt to get the authentication credentials for the URL's hostname from the
-user's netrc file.
-
-If credentials for the hostname are found, the request is sent with HTTP Basic
-Auth.
-
-
-Digest Authentication
----------------------
-
-Another very popular form of HTTP Authentication is Digest Authentication,
-and Requests supports this out of the box as well::
-
-    >>> from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth
-    >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/user/pass'
-    >>> requests.get(url, auth=HTTPDigestAuth('user', 'pass'))
-    <Response [200]>
-
-
-OAuth 1 Authentication
-----------------------
-
-A common form of authentication for several web APIs is OAuth. The ``requests-oauthlib``
-library allows Requests users to easily make OAuth authenticated requests::
-
-    >>> import requests
-    >>> from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1
-
-    >>> url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/verify_credentials.json'
-    >>> auth = OAuth1('YOUR_APP_KEY', 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
-                      'USER_OAUTH_TOKEN', 'USER_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET')
-
-    >>> requests.get(url, auth=auth)
-    <Response [200]>
-
-For more information on how to OAuth flow works, please see the official `OAuth`_ website.
-For examples and documentation on requests-oauthlib, please see the `requests_oauthlib`_
-repository on GitHub
-
-
-Other Authentication
---------------------
-
-Requests is designed to allow other forms of authentication to be easily and
-quickly plugged in. Members of the open-source community frequently write
-authentication handlers for more complicated or less commonly-used forms of
-authentication. Some of the best have been brought together under the
-`Requests organization`_, including:
-
-- Kerberos_
-- NTLM_
-
-If you want to use any of these forms of authentication, go straight to their
-GitHub page and follow the instructions.
-
-
-New Forms of Authentication
----------------------------
-
-If you can't find a good implementation of the form of authentication you
-want, you can implement it yourself. Requests makes it easy to add your own
-forms of authentication.
-
-To do so, subclass :class:`requests.auth.AuthBase` and implement the
-``__call__()`` method::
-
-    >>> import requests
-    >>> class MyAuth(requests.auth.AuthBase):
-    ...     def __call__(self, r):
-    ...         # Implement my authentication
-    ...         return r
-    ...
-    >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/get'
-    >>> requests.get(url, auth=MyAuth())
-    <Response [200]>
-
-When an authentication handler is attached to a request,
-it is called during request setup. The ``__call__`` method must therefore do
-whatever is required to make the authentication work. Some forms of
-authentication will additionally add hooks to provide further functionality.
-
-Further examples can be found under the `Requests organization`_ and in the
-``auth.py`` file.

-Quickstart
-==========
-
-.. module:: requests.models
-
-Eager to get started? This page gives a good introduction in how to get started
-with Requests. This assumes you already have Requests installed. If you do not,
-head over to the :ref:`Installation <install>` section.
-
-First, make sure that:
-
-* Requests is :ref:`installed <install>`
-* Requests is :ref:`up-to-date <updates>`
-
-
-Let's get started with some simple examples.
-
-
-Make a Request
---------------
-
-Making a request with Requests is very simple.
-
-Begin by importing the Requests module::
-
-    >>> import requests
-
-Now, let's try to get a webpage. For this example, let's get GitHub's public
-timeline ::
-
-    >>> r = requests.get('https://github.com/timeline.json')
-
-Now, we have a :class:`Response` object called ``r``. We can get all the
-information we need from this object.
-
-Requests' simple API means that all forms of HTTP request are as obvious. For
-example, this is how you make an HTTP POST request::
-
-    >>> r = requests.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
-
-Nice, right? What about the other HTTP request types: PUT, DELETE, HEAD and
-OPTIONS? These are all just as simple::
-
-    >>> r = requests.put("http://httpbin.org/put")
-    >>> r = requests.delete("http://httpbin.org/delete")
-    >>> r = requests.head("http://httpbin.org/get")
-    >>> r = requests.options("http://httpbin.org/get")
-
-That's all well and good, but it's also only the start of what Requests can
-do.
-
-
-Passing Parameters In URLs
---------------------------
-
-You often want to send some sort of data in the URL's query string. If
-you were constructing the URL by hand, this data would be given as key/value
-pairs in the URL after a question mark, e.g. ``httpbin.org/get?key=val``.
-Requests allows you to provide these arguments as a dictionary, using the
-``params`` keyword argument. As an example, if you wanted to pass
-``key1=value1`` and ``key2=value2`` to ``httpbin.org/get``, you would use the
-following code::
-
-    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
-    >>> r = requests.get("http://httpbin.org/get", params=payload)
-
-You can see that the URL has been correctly encoded by printing the URL::
-
-    >>> print r.url
-    http://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&key1=value1
-
-Note that any dictionary key whose value is ``None`` will not be added to the
-URL's query string.
-
-
-Response Content
-----------------
-
-We can read the content of the server's response. Consider the GitHub timeline
-again::
-
-    >>> import requests
-    >>> r = requests.get('https://github.com/timeline.json')
-    >>> r.text
-    u'[{"repository":{"open_issues":0,"url":"https://github.com/...
-
-Requests will automatically decode content from the server. Most unicode
-charsets are seamlessly decoded.
-
-When you make a request, Requests makes educated guesses about the encoding of
-the response based on the HTTP headers. The text encoding guessed by Requests
-is used when you access ``r.text``. You can find out what encoding Requests is
-using, and change it, using the ``r.encoding`` property::
-
-    >>> r.encoding
-    'utf-8'
-    >>> r.encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'
-
-If you change the encoding, Requests will use the new value of ``r.encoding``
-whenever you call ``r.text``.
-
-Requests will also use custom encodings in the event that you need them. If
-you have created your own encoding and registered it with the ``codecs``
-module, you can simply use the codec name as the value of ``r.encoding`` and
-Requests will handle the decoding for you.
-
-Binary Response Content
------------------------
-
-You can also access the response body as bytes, for non-text requests::
-
-    >>> r.content
-    b'[{"repository":{"open_issues":0,"url":"https://github.com/...
-
-The ``gzip`` and ``deflate`` transfer-encodings are automatically decoded for you.
-
-For example, to create an image from binary data returned by a request, you can
-use the following code::
-
-    >>> from PIL import Image
-    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
-    >>> i = Image.open(StringIO(r.content))
-
-
-JSON Response Content
----------------------
-
-There's also a builtin JSON decoder, in case you're dealing with JSON data::
-
-    >>> import requests
-    >>> r = requests.get('https://github.com/timeline.json')
-    >>> r.json()
-    [{u'repository': {u'open_issues': 0, u'url': 'https://github.com/...
-
-In case the JSON decoding fails, ``r.json`` raises an exception. For example, if
-the response gets a 401 (Unauthorized), attempting ``r.json`` raises ``ValueError:
-No JSON object could be decoded``
-
-
-Raw Response Content
---------------------
-
-In the rare case that you'd like to get the raw socket response from the
-server, you can access ``r.raw``. If you want to do this, make sure you set
-``stream=True`` in your initial request. Once you do, you can do this::
-
-    >>> r = requests.get('https://github.com/timeline.json', stream=True)
-    >>> r.raw
-    <requests.packages.urllib3.response.HTTPResponse object at 0x101194810>
-    >>> r.raw.read(10)
-    '\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x03'
-
-
-Custom Headers
---------------
-
-If you'd like to add HTTP headers to a request, simply pass in a ``dict`` to the
-``headers`` parameter.
-
-For example, we didn't specify our content-type in the previous example::
-
-    >>> import json
-    >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
-    >>> payload = {'some': 'data'}
-    >>> headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}
-
-    >>> r = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)
-
-
-More complicated POST requests
-------------------------------
-
-Typically, you want to send some form-encoded data — much like an HTML form.
-To do this, simply pass a dictionary to the ``data`` argument. Your
-dictionary of data will automatically be form-encoded when the request is made::
-
-    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
-    >>> r = requests.post("http://httpbin.org/post", data=payload)
-    >>> print r.text
-    {
-      ...
-      "form": {
-        "key2": "value2",
-        "key1": "value1"
-      },
-      ...
-    }
-
-There are many times that you want to send data that is not form-encoded. If you pass in a ``string`` instead of a ``dict``, that data will be posted directly.
-
-For example, the GitHub API v3 accepts JSON-Encoded POST/PATCH data::
-
-    >>> import json
-    >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
-    >>> payload = {'some': 'data'}
-
-    >>> r = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload))
-
-
-POST a Multipart-Encoded File
------------------------------
-
-Requests makes it simple to upload Multipart-encoded files::
-
-    >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/post'
-    >>> files = {'file': open('report.xls', 'rb')}
-
-    >>> r = requests.post(url, files=files)
-    >>> r.text
-    {
-      ...
-      "files": {
-        "file": "<censored...binary...data>"
-      },
-      ...
-    }
-
-You can set the filename explicitly::
-
-    >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/post'
-    >>> files = {'file': ('report.xls', open('report.xls', 'rb'))}
-
-    >>> r = requests.post(url, files=files)
-    >>> r.text
-    {
-      ...
-      "files": {
-        "file": "<censored...binary...data>"
-      },
-      ...
-    }
-
-If you want, you can send strings to be received as files::
-
-    >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/post'
-    >>> files = {'file': ('report.csv', 'some,data,to,send\nanother,row,to,send\n')}
-
-    >>> r = requests.post(url, files=files)
-    >>> r.text
-    {
-      ...
-      "files": {
-        "file": "some,data,to,send\\nanother,row,to,send\\n"
-      },
-      ...
-    }
-
-
-Response Status Codes
----------------------
-
-We can check the response status code::
-
-    >>> r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get')
-    >>> r.status_code
-    200
-
-Requests also comes with a built-in status code lookup object for easy
-reference::
-
-    >>> r.status_code == requests.codes.ok
-    True
-
-If we made a bad request (a 4XX client error or 5XX server error response), we can raise it with
-:class:`Response.raise_for_status()`::
-
-    >>> bad_r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/status/404')
-    >>> bad_r.status_code
-    404
-
-    >>> bad_r.raise_for_status()
-    Traceback (most recent call last):
-      File "requests/models.py", line 832, in raise_for_status
-        raise http_error
-    requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 404 Client Error
-
-But, since our ``status_code`` for ``r`` was ``200``, when we call
-``raise_for_status()`` we get::
-
-    >>> r.raise_for_status()
-    None
-
-All is well.
-
-
-Response Headers
-----------------
-
-We can view the server's response headers using a Python dictionary::
-
-    >>> r.headers
-    {
-        'content-encoding': 'gzip',
-        'transfer-encoding': 'chunked',
-        'connection': 'close',
-        'server': 'nginx/1.0.4',
-        'x-runtime': '148ms',
-        'etag': '"e1ca502697e5c9317743dc078f67693f"',
-        'content-type': 'application/json'
-    }
-
-The dictionary is special, though: it's made just for HTTP headers. According to
-`RFC 2616 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>`_, HTTP
-Headers are case-insensitive.
-
-So, we can access the headers using any capitalization we want::
-
-    >>> r.headers['Content-Type']
-    'application/json'
-
-    >>> r.headers.get('content-type')
-    'application/json'
-
-
-Cookies
--------
-
-If a response contains some Cookies, you can get quick access to them::
-
-    >>> url = 'http://example.com/some/cookie/setting/url'
-    >>> r = requests.get(url)
-
-    >>> r.cookies['example_cookie_name']
-    'example_cookie_value'
-
-To send your own cookies to the server, you can use the ``cookies``
-parameter::
-
-    >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/cookies'
-    >>> cookies = dict(cookies_are='working')
-
-    >>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
-    >>> r.text
-    '{"cookies": {"cookies_are": "working"}}'
-
-
-Redirection and History
------------------------
-
-Requests will automatically perform location redirection while using the GET
-and OPTIONS verbs.
-
-GitHub redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS. We can use the ``history`` method
-of the Response object to track redirection. Let's see what GitHub does::
-
-    >>> r = requests.get('http://github.com')
-    >>> r.url
-    'https://github.com/'
-    >>> r.status_code
-    200
-    >>> r.history
-    [<Response [301]>]
-
-The :class:`Response.history` list contains the :class:`Request` objects that
-were created in order to complete the request. The list is sorted from the
-oldest to the most recent request.
-
-If you're using GET or OPTIONS, you can disable redirection handling with the
-``allow_redirects`` parameter::
-
-    >>> r = requests.get('http://github.com', allow_redirects=False)
-    >>> r.status_code
-    301
-    >>> r.history
-    []
-
-If you're using POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE or HEAD, you can enable
-redirection as well::
-
-    >>> r = requests.post('http://github.com', allow_redirects=True)
-    >>> r.url
-    'https://github.com/'
-    >>> r.history
-    [<Response [301]>]
-
-
-Timeouts
---------
-
-You can tell Requests to stop waiting for a response after a given number of
-seconds with the ``timeout`` parameter::
-
-    >>> requests.get('http://github.com', timeout=0.001)
-    Traceback (most recent call last):
-      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
-    requests.exceptions.Timeout: HTTPConnectionPool(host='github.com', port=80): Request timed out. (timeout=0.001)
-
-
-.. admonition:: Note
-
-    ``timeout`` is not a time limit on the entire response download;
-    rather, an exception is raised if the server has not issued a
-    response for ``timeout`` seconds (more precisely, if no bytes have been
-    received on the underlying socket for ``timeout`` seconds).
-
-
-Errors and Exceptions
----------------------
-
-In the event of a network problem (e.g. DNS failure, refused connection, etc),
-Requests will raise a :class:`~requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` exception.
-
-In the event of the rare invalid HTTP response, Requests will raise an
-:class:`~requests.exceptions.HTTPError` exception.
-
-If a request times out, a :class:`~requests.exceptions.Timeout` exception is
-raised.
-
-If a request exceeds the configured number of maximum redirections, a
-:class:`~requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects` exception is raised.
-
-All exceptions that Requests explicitly raises inherit from
-:class:`requests.exceptions.RequestException`.

-requests HTTP library
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings. Basic GET
-usage:
-
-   >>> import requests
-   >>> r = requests.get('http://python.org')
-   >>> r.status_code
-   200
-   >>> 'Python is a programming language' in r.content
-   True
-
-... or POST:
-
-   >>> payload = dict(key1='value1', key2='value2')
-   >>> r = requests.post("http://httpbin.org/post", data=payload)
-   >>> print r.text
-   {
-     ...
-     "form": {
-       "key2": "value2",
-       "key1": "value1"
-     },
-     ...
-   }
-
-The other HTTP methods are supported - see `requests.api`. Full documentation
-is at <http://python-requests.org>.

-Beautiful Soup uses a pluggable XML or HTML parser to parse a
-(possibly invalid) document into a tree representation. Beautiful Soup
-provides provides methods and Pythonic idioms that make it easy to
-navigate, search, and modify the parse tree.
-
-Beautiful Soup works with Python 2.6 and up. It works better if lxml
-and/or html5lib is installed.

-        to succeed. Omitting the parameter will default the connect timeout to
-        the system default, probably `the global default timeout in socket.py
-        <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/603b4d593758/Lib/socket.py#l535>`_.
-        None will set an infinite timeout for connection attempts.
-
-    :type connect: integer, float, or None
-
-    :param read:
-        The maximum amount of time to wait between consecutive
-        read operations for a response from the server. Omitting
-        the parameter will default the read timeout to the system
-        default, probably `the global default timeout in socket.py
-        <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/603b4d593758/Lib/socket.py#l535>`_.
-        None will set an infinite timeout.
-
-    :type read: integer, float, or None
-
-    :param total:
-        The maximum amount of time to wait for an HTTP request to connect and
-        return. This combines the connect and read timeouts into one. In the
-        event that both a connect timeout and a total are specified, or a read
-        timeout and a total are specified, the shorter timeout will be applied.
-
-        Defaults to None.
-
-
-    :type total: integer, float, or None
-
-    .. note::
-
-        Many factors can affect the total amount of time for urllib3 to return
-        an HTTP response. Specifically, Python's DNS resolver does not obey the
-        timeout specified on the socket. Other factors that can affect total
-        request time include high CPU load, high swap, the program running at a
-        low priority level, or other behaviors. The observed running time for
-        urllib3 to return a response may be greater than the value passed to
-        `total`.
-
-        In addition, the read and total timeouts only measure the time between
-        read operations on the socket connecting the client and the server, not
-        the total amount of time for the request to return a complete response.
-        As an example, you may want a request to return within 7 seconds or
-        fail, so you set the ``total`` timeout to 7 seconds. If the server
-        sends one byte to you every 5 seconds, the request will **not** trigger
-        time out. This case is admittedly rare.

+2.3.0 (2014-05-16)
+++++++++++++++++++

+**API Changes**
+
+- New ``Response`` property ``is_redirect``, which is true when the

+  ``stream=False`` equally.
+- The change in v2.0.0 to mandate explicit proxy schemes has been reverted.

+- Assorted urllib3 fixes.
+
+2.2.0 (2014-01-09)

+- Avoid many many exceptions from the buggy implementation of ``proxy_bypass`` on OS X in Python 2.6.
+- Avoid crashing when attempting to get authentication credentials from ~/.netrc when running as a user without a home directory.
+- Use the correct pool size for pools of connections to proxies.
+- Fix iteration of ``CookieJar`` objects.
+- Ensure that cookies are persisted over redirect.
+- Switch back to using chardet, since it has merged with charade.
+
+2.1.0 (2013-12-05)
+++++++++++++++++++
+
+- Updated CA Bundle, of course.
+- Cookies set on individual Requests through a ``Session`` (e.g. via ``Session.get()``) are no longer persisted to the ``Session``.

+- Updated internal urllib3.
+- Fixed @Lukasa's lack of taste.
+
+2.0.1 (2013-10-24)
+++++++++++++++++++
+

+
+2.0.0 (2013-09-24)
+++++++++++++++++++
+
+**API Changes:**
+
+- Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python versions,
+  i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.
+- Proxy URLs now *must* have an explicit scheme. A ``MissingSchema`` exception
+  will be raised if they don't.
+- Timeouts now apply to read time if ``Stream=False``.
+- ``RequestException`` is now a subclass of ``IOError``, not ``RuntimeError``.
+- Added new method to ``PreparedRequest`` objects: ``PreparedRequest.copy()``.
+- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.update_request()``. This
+  method updates a ``Request`` object with the data (e.g. cookies) stored on
+  the ``Session``.
+- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.prepare_request()``. This
+  method updates and prepares a ``Request`` object, and returns the
+  corresponding ``PreparedRequest`` object.
+- Added new method to ``HTTPAdapter`` objects: ``HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()``.
+  This should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.
+- ``httplib.IncompleteRead`` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding
+  will now raise a Requests ``ChunkedEncodingError`` instead.
+- Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ``InvalidURL``
+  exception to be raised.
+- HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase ``"im_used"``. Correctly uses
+  ``"already_reported"``.
+- HTTP 226 reason added (``"im_used"``).
+
+**Bugfixes:**

+- Vastly improved proxy support, including the CONNECT verb. Special thanks to
+  the many contributors who worked towards this improvement.

+        =========================

+        .. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/requests.png
+            :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/requests

+                :target: https://crate.io/packages/requests/
+        
+        
+        Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human
+        beings.
+        
+        Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely
+        verbose and cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most of
+        the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly broken.
+        It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to
+        perform the simplest of tasks.
+        
+        Things shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.
+        
+        .. code-block:: python
+        
+            >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))
+            >>> r.status_code
+            204
+            >>> r.headers['content-type']
+            'application/json'
+            >>> r.text
+            ...
+        
+        See `the same code, without Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.
+        
+        Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data,
+        multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the
+        response data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and `urllib3
+        <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_, but it does all the hard work and crazy
+        hacks for you.
+

+        
+        **API Changes**
+        
+        - New ``Response`` property ``is_redirect``, which is true when the
+          library could have processed this response as a redirection (whether
+          or not it actually did).
+        - The ``timeout`` parameter now affects requests with both ``stream=True`` and
+          ``stream=False`` equally.
+        - The change in v2.0.0 to mandate explicit proxy schemes has been reverted.
+          Proxy schemes now default to ``http://``.
+        - The ``CaseInsensitiveDict`` used for HTTP headers now behaves like a normal
+          dictionary when references as string or viewed in the interpreter.
+        
+        **Bugfixes**
+        
+        - No longer expose Authorization or Proxy-Authorization headers on redirect.
+          Fix CVE-2014-1829 and CVE-2014-1830 respectively.
+        - Authorization is re-evaluated each redirect.
+        - On redirect, pass url as native strings.
+        - Fall-back to autodetected encoding for JSON when Unicode detection fails.
+        - Headers set to ``None`` on the ``Session`` are now correctly not sent.
+        - Correctly honor ``decode_unicode`` even if it wasn't used earlier in the same
+          response.
+        - Stop advertising ``compress`` as a supported Content-Encoding.
+        - The ``Response.history`` parameter is now always a list.
+        - Many, many ``urllib3`` bugfixes.
+        
+        2.2.1 (2014-01-23)
+        ++++++++++++++++++
+

+        - Avoid crashing when attempting to get authentication credentials from ~/.netrc when running as a user without a home directory.
+        - Use the correct pool size for pools of connections to proxies.
+        - Fix iteration of ``CookieJar`` objects.
+        - Ensure that cookies are persisted over redirect.
+        - Switch back to using chardet, since it has merged with charade.
+        
+        2.1.0 (2013-12-05)
+        ++++++++++++++++++
+        
+        - Updated CA Bundle, of course.
+        - Cookies set on individual Requests through a ``Session`` (e.g. via ``Session.get()``) are no longer persisted to the ``Session``.
+        - Clean up connections when we hit problems during chunked upload, rather than leaking them.
+        - Return connections to the pool when a chunked upload is successful, rather than leaking it.
+        - Match the HTTPbis recommendation for HTTP 301 redirects.
+        - Prevent hanging when using streaming uploads and Digest Auth when a 401 is received.
+        - Values of headers set by Requests are now always the native string type.

+        - More resilient cookie handling.
+        - Make ``Response`` objects pickleable.
+        - Actually added MD5-sess to Digest Auth instead of pretending to like last time.
+        - Updated internal urllib3.
+        - Fixed @Lukasa's lack of taste.
+        
+        2.0.1 (2013-10-24)
+        ++++++++++++++++++
+        
+        - Updated included CA Bundle with new mistrusts and automated process for the future
+        - Added MD5-sess to Digest Auth
+        - Accept per-file headers in multipart file POST messages.
+        - Fixed: Don't send the full URL on CONNECT messages.
+        - Fixed: Correctly lowercase a redirect scheme.
+        - Fixed: Cookies not persisted when set via functional API.
+        - Fixed: Translate urllib3 ProxyError into a requests ProxyError derived from ConnectionError.
+        - Updated internal urllib3 and chardet.
+        
+        2.0.0 (2013-09-24)
+        ++++++++++++++++++
+        
+        **API Changes:**
+        
+        - Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python versions,
+          i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.
+        - Proxy URLs now *must* have an explicit scheme. A ``MissingSchema`` exception
+          will be raised if they don't.
+        - Timeouts now apply to read time if ``Stream=False``.
+        - ``RequestException`` is now a subclass of ``IOError``, not ``RuntimeError``.
+        - Added new method to ``PreparedRequest`` objects: ``PreparedRequest.copy()``.
+        - Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.update_request()``. This
+          method updates a ``Request`` object with the data (e.g. cookies) stored on
+          the ``Session``.
+        - Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.prepare_request()``. This
+          method updates and prepares a ``Request`` object, and returns the
+          corresponding ``PreparedRequest`` object.
+        - Added new method to ``HTTPAdapter`` objects: ``HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()``.
+          This should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.
+        - ``httplib.IncompleteRead`` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding
+          will now raise a Requests ``ChunkedEncodingError`` instead.
+        - Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ``InvalidURL``
+          exception to be raised.
+        - HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase ``"im_used"``. Correctly uses
+          ``"already_reported"``.
+        - HTTP 226 reason added (``"im_used"``).
+        
+        **Bugfixes:**
+        
+        - Vastly improved proxy support, including the CONNECT verb. Special thanks to
+          the many contributors who worked towards this improvement.
+        - Cookies are now properly managed when 401 authentication responses are
+          received.
+        - Chunked encoding fixes.
+        - Support for mixed case schemes.
+        - Better handling of streaming downloads.
+        - Retrieve environment proxies from more locations.
+        - Minor cookies fixes.
+        - Improved redirect behaviour.
+        - Improved streaming behaviour, particularly for compressed data.
+        - Miscellaneous small Python 3 text encoding bugs.
+        - ``.netrc`` no longer overrides explicit auth.
+        - Cookies set by hooks are now correctly persisted on Sessions.
+        - Fix problem with cookies that specify port numbers in their host field.
+        - ``BytesIO`` can be used to perform streaming uploads.
+        - More generous parsing of the ``no_proxy`` environment variable.
+        - Non-string objects can be passed in data values alongside files.
+        
+        1.2.3 (2013-05-25)
+        ++++++++++++++++++
+        
+        - Simple packaging fix
+        
+        
+        1.2.2 (2013-05-23)
+        ++++++++++++++++++
+        
+        - Simple packaging fix
+        
+        
+        1.2.1 (2013-05-20)
+        ++++++++++++++++++
+        
+        - 301 and 302 redirects now change the verb to GET for all verbs, not just
+          POST, improving browser compatibility.
+        - Python 3.3.2 compatibility
+        - Always percent-encode location headers
+        - Fix connection adapter matching to be most-specific first
+        - new argument to the default connection adapter for passing a block argument
+        - prevent a KeyError when there's no link headers
+        
+        1.2.0 (2013-03-31)
+        ++++++++++++++++++
+        
+        - Fixed cookies on sessions and on requests
+        - Significantly change how hooks are dispatched - hooks now receive all the
+          arguments specified by the user when making a request so hooks can make a
+          secondary request with the same parameters. This is especially necessary for
+          authentication handler authors
+        - certifi support was removed
+        - Fixed bug where using OAuth 1 with body ``signature_type`` sent no data
+        - Major proxy work thanks to @Lukasa including parsing of proxy authentication
+          from the proxy url
+        - Fix DigestAuth handling too many 401s
+        - Update vendored urllib3 to include SSL bug fixes
+        - Allow keyword arguments to be passed to ``json.loads()`` via the
+          ``Response.json()`` method
+        - Don't send ``Content-Length`` header by default on ``GET`` or ``HEAD``
+          requests
+        - Add ``elapsed`` attribute to ``Response`` objects to time how long a request
+          took.
+        - Fix ``RequestsCookieJar``
+        - Sessions and Adapters are now picklable, i.e., can be used with the
+          multiprocessing library
+        - Update charade to version 1.0.3
+        
+        The change in how hooks are dispatched will likely cause a great deal of
+        issues.
+

+Requests: HTTP for Humans
+=========================
+
+.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/requests.png
+    :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/requests
+
+.. image:: https://pypip.in/d/requests/badge.png
+        :target: https://crate.io/packages/requests/
+
+
+Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human
+beings.
+
+Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely
+verbose and cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most of
+the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly broken.
+It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to
+perform the simplest of tasks.
+
+Things shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))
+    >>> r.status_code
+    204
+    >>> r.headers['content-type']
+    'application/json'
+    >>> r.text
+    ...
+
+See `the same code, without Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.
+
+Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data,
+multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the
+response data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and `urllib3
+<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_, but it does all the hard work and crazy
+hacks for you.
+
+
+Features
+--------
+
+- International Domains and URLs
+- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
+- Sessions with Cookie Persistence
+- Browser-style SSL Verification
+- Basic/Digest Authentication
+- Elegant Key/Value Cookies
+- Automatic Decompression
+- Unicode Response Bodies
+- Multipart File Uploads
+- Connection Timeouts
+- Thread-safety
+- HTTP(S) proxy support
+
+
+Installation
+------------
+
+To install Requests, simply:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ pip install requests

+requests HTTP library
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings. Basic GET
+usage:
+
+   >>> import requests
+   >>> r = requests.get('https://www.python.org')
+   >>> r.status_code
+   200
+   >>> 'Python is a programming language' in r.content
+   True
+
+... or POST:
+
+   >>> payload = dict(key1='value1', key2='value2')
+   >>> r = requests.post('http://httpbin.org/post', data=payload)
+   >>> print(r.text)
+   {
+     ...
+     "form": {
+       "key2": "value2",
+       "key1": "value1"
+     },
+     ...
+   }
+
+The other HTTP methods are supported - see `requests.api`. Full documentation
+is at <http://python-requests.org>.

+
+# This prober doesn't actually recognize a language or a charset.
+# It is a helper prober for the use of the Hebrew model probers
+
+### General ideas of the Hebrew charset recognition ###
+#
+# Four main charsets exist in Hebrew:
+# "ISO-8859-8" - Visual Hebrew
+# "windows-1255" - Logical Hebrew
+# "ISO-8859-8-I" - Logical Hebrew
+# "x-mac-hebrew" - ?? Logical Hebrew ??
+#
+# Both "ISO" charsets use a completely identical set of code points, whereas
+# "windows-1255" and "x-mac-hebrew" are two different proper supersets of
+# these code points. windows-1255 defines additional characters in the range
+# 0x80-0x9F as some misc punctuation marks as well as some Hebrew-specific
+# diacritics and additional 'Yiddish' ligature letters in the range 0xc0-0xd6.
+# x-mac-hebrew defines similar additional code points but with a different
+# mapping.
+#
+# As far as an average Hebrew text with no diacritics is concerned, all four
+# charsets are identical with respect to code points. Meaning that for the
+# main Hebrew alphabet, all four map the same values to all 27 Hebrew letters
+# (including final letters).
+#
+# The dominant difference between these charsets is their directionality.
+# "Visual" directionality means that the text is ordered as if the renderer is
+# not aware of a BIDI rendering algorithm. The renderer sees the text and
+# draws it from left to right. The text itself when ordered naturally is read
+# backwards. A buffer of Visual Hebrew generally looks like so:
+# "[last word of first line spelled backwards] [whole line ordered backwards
+# and spelled backwards] [first word of first line spelled backwards]
+# [end of line] [last word of second line] ... etc' "
+# adding punctuation marks, numbers and English text to visual text is
+# naturally also "visual" and from left to right.
+#
+# "Logical" directionality means the text is ordered "naturally" according to
+# the order it is read. It is the responsibility of the renderer to display
+# the text from right to left. A BIDI algorithm is used to place general
+# punctuation marks, numbers and English text in the text.
+#
+# Texts in x-mac-hebrew are almost impossible to find on the Internet. From
+# what little evidence I could find, it seems that its general directionality
+# is Logical.
+#
+# To sum up all of the above, the Hebrew probing mechanism knows about two
+# charsets:
+# Visual Hebrew - "ISO-8859-8" - backwards text - Words and sentences are
+#    backwards while line order is natural. For charset recognition purposes
+#    the line order is unimportant (In fact, for this implementation, even
+#    word order is unimportant).
+# Logical Hebrew - "windows-1255" - normal, naturally ordered text.
+#
+# "ISO-8859-8-I" is a subset of windows-1255 and doesn't need to be
+#    specifically identified.
+# "x-mac-hebrew" is also identified as windows-1255. A text in x-mac-hebrew
+#    that contain special punctuation marks or diacritics is displayed with
+#    some unconverted characters showing as question marks. This problem might
+#    be corrected using another model prober for x-mac-hebrew. Due to the fact
+#    that x-mac-hebrew texts are so rare, writing another model prober isn't
+#    worth the effort and performance hit.
+#
+#### The Prober ####
+#
+# The prober is divided between two SBCharSetProbers and a HebrewProber,
+# all of which are managed, created, fed data, inquired and deleted by the
+# SBCSGroupProber. The two SBCharSetProbers identify that the text is in
+# fact some kind of Hebrew, Logical or Visual. The final decision about which
+# one is it is made by the HebrewProber by combining final-letter scores
+# with the scores of the two SBCharSetProbers to produce a final answer.
+#
+# The SBCSGroupProber is responsible for stripping the original text of HTML
+# tags, English characters, numbers, low-ASCII punctuation characters, spaces
+# and new lines. It reduces any sequence of such characters to a single space.
+# The buffer fed to each prober in the SBCS group prober is pure text in
+# high-ASCII.
+# The two SBCharSetProbers (model probers) share the same language model:
+# Win1255Model.
+# The first SBCharSetProber uses the model normally as any other
+# SBCharSetProber does, to recognize windows-1255, upon which this model was
+# built. The second SBCharSetProber is told to make the pair-of-letter
+# lookup in the language model backwards. This in practice exactly simulates
+# a visual Hebrew model using the windows-1255 logical Hebrew model.
+#
+# The HebrewProber is not using any language model. All it does is look for
+# final-letter evidence suggesting the text is either logical Hebrew or visual
+# Hebrew. Disjointed from the model probers, the results of the HebrewProber
+# alone are meaningless. HebrewProber always returns 0.00 as confidence
+# since it never identifies a charset by itself. Instead, the pointer to the
+# HebrewProber is passed to the model probers as a helper "Name Prober".
+# When the Group prober receives a positive identification from any prober,
+# it asks for the name of the charset identified. If the prober queried is a
+# Hebrew model prober, the model prober forwards the call to the
+# HebrewProber to make the final decision. In the HebrewProber, the
+# decision is made according to the final-letters scores maintained and Both
+# model probers scores. The answer is returned in the form of the name of the
+# charset identified, either "windows-1255" or "ISO-8859-8".

+'''SSL with SNI_-support for Python 2. Follow these instructions if you would
+like to verify SSL certificates in Python 2. Note, the default libraries do
+*not* do certificate checking; you need to do additional work to validate
+certificates yourself.
+
+This needs the following packages installed:
+
+* pyOpenSSL (tested with 0.13)
+* ndg-httpsclient (tested with 0.3.2)
+* pyasn1 (tested with 0.1.6)
+
+You can install them with the following command:
+
+    pip install pyopenssl ndg-httpsclient pyasn1
+
+To activate certificate checking, call
+:func:`~urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3` from your Python code
+before you begin making HTTP requests. This can be done in a ``sitecustomize``
+module, or at any other time before your application begins using ``urllib3``,
+like this::
+
+    try:
+        import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
+        urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()
+    except ImportError:
+        pass
+
+Now you can use :mod:`urllib3` as you normally would, and it will support SNI
+when the required modules are installed.
+
+Activating this module also has the positive side effect of disabling SSL/TLS
+compression in Python 2 (see `CRIME attack`_).
+
+If you want to configure the default list of supported cipher suites, you can
+set the ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.DEFAULT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST`` variable.
+

+        the payload with the appropriate content type. Otherwise

+        signing, such as with OAuth.

+            }
+
+        When uploading a file, providing a filename (the first parameter of the

+

+        or other behaviors.

+        read operations on the socket connecting the client and the server,
+        not the total amount of time for the request to return a complete
+        response. For most requests, the timeout is raised because the server
+        has not sent the first byte in the specified time. This is not always
+        the case; if a server streams one byte every fifteen seconds, a timeout
+        of 20 seconds will not trigger, even though the request will take
+        several minutes to complete.
+
+        If your goal is to cut off any request after a set amount of wall clock
